# Pizza Menu Project at The Tech Academy

## Objective
In this project, a pretend client is asking me to create an online pizza menu system. I completed the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some help from Bootstrap 4. Below are the site requirements as submitted by the 'client:'
  
THE MENU WILL NEED TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING:
* Radio buttons for a size selection:
* Personal, Medium, Large, and Extra Large
Checkboxes for multiple selection of meats:
* Pepperoni, Sausage, Canadian Bacon, Ground Beef, Anchovy, and Chicken
Radio buttons for a cheese selection:
* Regular, No cheese, Extra Cheese
Radio buttons for a crust selection:
* Plain Crust, Garlic Butter Crust, Cheese Stuffed Crust, Spicy Crust, and House Special Crust
Radio buttons for a sauce selection:
* Marinara sauce, White sauce, Barbecue sauce, and No Sauce
Checkboxes for multiple selection of veggies:
* Tomatoes, Onions, Olives, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Pineapple, Spinach, and Jalapeno
  
BASE PIZZA PRICE BEFORE INGREDIENT MODIFICATIONS:
* Personal pizza = $6.00
* Medium pizza = $10.00
* Large pizza = $14.00
* XLarge pizza = $16.00
  
INGREDIENT MODIFIER PRICING:
*The following ingredients if selected will be added to the base pizza price:*
* Additional Meat items *(first one is complementary, +$1.00 each additional meat items beyond the first complementary meat item)*
* Additional Veggie items *(first one is complementary, +$1.00 each additional veggie items beyond the first complementary veggie item)*
* Extra Cheese *+$3.00 for any size pizza*
* Crust *+$3.00 for Cheese Stuffed Crust. All other crusts are complementary.*
  
EXPECTATIONS:
Your HTML/CSS/JavaScript will need to present the menu and retrive the patron's selection and return an invoiced receipt to the user's screen with their total purchase price once they press an "Order" button.

## Result:
From a blank HTML file, I used Bootstrap 4 to pull together the HTML and CSS framework. Then I added JavaScript to meet the project requirements. I consider myself a backend developer first and foremost but I did have fun with this project. Once I familiarized myself with Bootstrap 4 and CSS hierarchy, things became much less frustrating and much more rewarding.
